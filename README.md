-This is the client-side portion of GAMEPLAN, an easy-to-use application that allows users to create and keep track of goals.

Technologies used:

Future Updates:
-I want users to be able to nest goals inside of goals, creating 'sub-goals' inside of 'goal' folders.
-I want to use bootstrap to put individual goals inside their own boxes.

#gameplan#

-This is the client-side component of GAMEPLAN, an easy-to-use application that allows users to create and keep track of goals. The server-side component repository can be found here: https://github.com/kdoxsey/gameplan-project-api

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
JQuery
Ajax

Future Updates:
-I want users to be able to nest goals inside of goals, creating 'sub-goals' inside of 'goal' folders.
-I want to use bootstrap to put individual goals inside their own boxes.
-I want to utilize a checkbox feature that allows users to mark a goal as "complete" or "incomplete"

Planning and Developement:
-I wanted to create a smooth user experience using jQuery's show and hide features. Rather than having all CRUD forms visible at the same time, the user must click on one of the buttons to load its respective form.
-The client-side application communicates with the server-side component using an API. The API handles authorization requests as well as CRUD requests.
